evo-slides-git
==============

These are slides for my talk about git internals and some git tricks I gave at [EVO Summer Python Lab'16](https://www.facebook.com/evosummerpythonlab).

Slides are built on top of [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/) presentation framework. See framework's [README](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/README.md) to know how to run these slides locally.
